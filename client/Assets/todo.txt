Verify that...
* Address "todo" in all example code.
* Naming is consistent
* classes are consistent with scene naming
* code compiles


After the above...

* Get a code review
* Copy to readme
* Above every readme snippet add a readme variable and/or callout that says "To see the latest sample, find it here..." and decide where that is (Repo, in the SDK, etc...)
