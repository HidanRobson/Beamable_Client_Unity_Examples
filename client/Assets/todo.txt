Verify that...
* Naming is consitent
* classes are consistent with scene naming
* code compiles
* every Start has a Debug.Log("Start()"); with optional additional words
* private classes are above the main example
* if a folder should NOT have the full code pasted into the readme, then break example into 2+ files, so its clear which one to paste into readme


After the above...

* Get a code review
* Copy to readme
* Above every readme snippet add a readme variable and/or callout that says "To see the latest sample, find it here..." and decide where that is (Repo, in the SDK, etc...)
